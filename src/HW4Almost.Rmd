### Question 1

Using damages.csv, estimate a quadratic damage function relating the dollar value of damages to the change in global mean temperature. Estimate a model with a zero intercept because damages by construction must equal zero when there is no climate change. Plot your estimated damage function, overlaid with a scatterplot of the underlying data.

```{r}
## read in data
warming <- read.csv(here("data", "warming.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() 
damages <- read.csv(here("data", "damages.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names() 
```

```{r}
damages$warming2 <- damages$warming ^ 2
predicted.lm <- lm(damages ~ 0 + warming + warming2 -1, data = damages)
damages$seq_temp = seq(.1, 10, length.out = 556)
```

```{r}
pred_dam_fun <- function(x){predicted.lm$coefficients[1]*x + predicted.lm$coefficients[2]*x^2}
pulse <- 35000000000
ggplot(data = damages, aes(y = damages, x = warming)) +
  geom_jitter()+
  labs(x = "Temperature (C)",
       y = "Damages ($)",
       title = "Fig 1: Damages per Degree Increase") +
stat_function(fun = pred_dam_fun, color = "red") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Question 2

Use warming.csv and your estimated damage function to predict damages in each year under the baseline climate and the pulse scenario. Make four plots: (1) damages over time without the pulse, (2) damages over time with the pulse, (3) the difference in damages over time that arises from the pulse, and (4) the difference in damages over time from the pulse per ton of CO2 (you can assume that each ton of the pulse causes the same amount of damage).

```{r}
warming <- warming %>% 
  mutate(pred_base = pred_dam_fun(x = warming_baseline)) %>% 
  mutate(pred_pulse = pred_dam_fun(x = warming_pulse)) %>% 
  mutate(diff_of_pulse = pred_pulse - pred_base) %>% 
  mutate(damage_per_ton = diff_of_pulse/pulse)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = warming, aes(x = year, y = pred_base)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Damage ($)",
       title = "Fig 2: Damages over time without pulse of CO2") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(data = warming, aes(x = year, y = pred_pulse)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Damages ($)",
       title = "Fig 3: Damages over time with pulse of CO2") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(data = warming, aes(x = year, y = diff_of_pulse)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Change in Damages ($)",
       title = "Fig 4: Difference in Damages Over Time that Arises from the Pulse") +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(data = warming, aes(x = year, y = damage_per_ton)) +
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Damages per ton of CO2($)",
       title = "Fig 5: Difference in Damages over time from the Pulse per ton of CO2") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Question 3

The SCC is the present discounted value of the stream of future damages caused by one additional ton of CO2. The Obama Administration used a discount rate of 3% to discount damages. Recently, New York State used a discount rate of 2%. Calculate and make a plot of the SCC (y-axis) against the discount rate (x-axis) for a reasonable range of discount rates. Explain the intuition for how the discount rate affects the SCC.

```{r}
SCC <- warming %>% 
  mutate(dr_01 = damage_per_ton/((1 + .01)^(year-2022))) %>% 
  mutate(dr_02 = damage_per_ton/((1 + .02)^(year-2022))) %>%
  mutate(dr_03 = damage_per_ton/((1 + .03)^(year-2022))) %>% 
  mutate(dr_04 = damage_per_ton/((1 + .04)^(year-2022))) %>%
  mutate(dr_05 = damage_per_ton/((1 + .05)^(year-2022))) %>% 
  mutate(dr_06 = damage_per_ton/((1 + .06)^(year-2022))) %>% 
  mutate(dr_07 = damage_per_ton/((1 + .07)^(year-2022))) %>%
  mutate(dr_08 = damage_per_ton/((1 + .08)^(year-2022))) %>% 
  mutate(dr_09 = damage_per_ton/((1 + .09)^(year-2022))) %>% 
  mutate(dr_1 = damage_per_ton/((1 + .1)^(year-2022)))
discount_rate <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
scc_sums <- c(sum(SCC$dr_01), sum(SCC$dr_02), sum(SCC$dr_03), sum(SCC$dr_04), sum(SCC$dr_05), sum(SCC$dr_06), sum(SCC$dr_07), sum(SCC$dr_08), sum(SCC$dr_09), sum(SCC$dr_1))
scc_data_frame <- data.frame(discount_rate, scc_sums)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = scc_data_frame, aes(x = discount_rate, y = scc_sums)) +
 geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Discount Rate (%)", 
       y = "SCC",
       title = "SCC with Different Discount Rates",
caption = "Fig 6: SCC over a Range of Different Discount Rates (1% to 10%)")+
    theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

### Question 4

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine advised the government in a 2017 report to use the Ramsey Rule when discounting within the SCC calculation:

r = ρ + ηg

Using ρ = 0.001, η = 2, and g = 0.01, what is the SCC? Locate this point on your graph from above.

```{r}
# r  = p + ng
# find r when p = .001, n = 2, and g = 0.01

rr <- .001 + 2 * .01 # = 0.021
SCC <- warming %>% 
  mutate(dr_rr = damage_per_ton/((1 + .021)^(year-2022))) 
dr_rr_sum <- c(sum(SCC$dr_rr)) # = 71.354

```

### Question 5

Now suppose there are two possible climate policies that can be pursued. Policy A is business as usual and Policy B is to take immediate and strong action on climate change.

-   What is the expected present value of damages up to 2100 under Policy A? $2.10*10^{15}$ \$

-   What is the expected present value of damages up to 2100 under Policy B? $7.72*10^{14}$ \$

-   Suppose undertaking Policy A costs zero and undertaking Policy B costs X. The total cost of a policy is the implementation cost plus expected damages. Make a plot of total cost of Policy A and total cost of Policy B against X. Suppose Congress wants to undertake the policy with the lower total cost. Use your graph to advise Congress.

We would advise Congress to implement policy A if the cost of implementation is less than $1.2*10^{15}$ dollars

```{r}
discount_rate2 <- 2 

warming_policy <- warming %>% 
  mutate(policy_a1 = warming_baseline,
         policy_a2 = 1.5*warming_baseline,
         policy_b = ifelse(year < 2050, policy_a2, 1.29)) %>% 
  mutate(damages_a = quad_function(policy_a2)) %>% 
  mutate(damages_b = quad_function(policy_b)) %>% 
  mutate(future_years = year-2022) %>% 
  mutate(discount_policy_a2 = damages_a/(1.02^future_years)) %>% 
  mutate(discount_policy_b = damages_b/(1.02^future_years)) %>% 
  mutate(discount_damages_bau = warming_baseline/1.02^future_years)


prob_policy_a <- 0.5*sum(warming_policy$discount_policy_a2) + 0.5*sum(warming_policy$discount_damages_bau)

prob_policy_b <- c(sum(warming_policy$discount_policy_b))

cost_a <- function(x){prob_policy_a}


cost_b <- function(x){prob_policy_b + x}

intercept <- prob_policy_a - prob_policy_b

```

```{r}
cost <- seq(0, 5e15, by = 1e12)
cost_df <- data.frame(cost) %>% 
  mutate(cost_policy_b = prob_policy_b + cost) %>% 
  mutate(cost_policy_a = prob_policy_a) 

```

```{r}

ggplot(data = cost_df) +
 geom_line(aes(x = cost/1e12, y = cost_policy_a/1e12), color = "red") +
  geom_line(aes(x = cost/1e12, y = cost_policy_b/1e12), color = "blue") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 6000), n.breaks = 6) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 5100), n.breaks = 5) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 5100, y = 2100, label = "Policy A")) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 5100, y = 6000, label = "Plicy B furgeson")) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 1200, y = 6000, label = "X = 1200")) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = intercept/1e12, linetype = "dashed", color = "darkorchid") +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "darkblue")) +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "pink")) +
  labs(title = "Policy Comparison", x = "Cost of Policy Implementation ", y = "Total Expected Cost") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 
```

### Question 6

Now suppose that society is risk averse. How do you think this would change your advice to Congress?

We would reccomend that Congress use policy B. The benefits of reduced climate change outweigh the cost of implementing the policy. Option B guarantees lower future damages compared to the higher damage potential of Policy A. However, if the cost of implementing policy B is greater than $1.2*10^{15}$ dollars then Congress has to make a game time decision.
